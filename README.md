# Cyberpunk 2020 characters manager

This project has been made for the course mobile programming.
The purpose of this project is an application to help cyberpunk 2020 players to better manage their characters, without neither the help of the paper manual, nor the need for the dices(these features are implemented in the app).
A person can create many characters, managing the equipment and the statistics of the characters, as the actual state of the one.
The manual is inside the app, so one can check the rules istantly.
The dice roller is another feature.
At the moment, I haven't added all the manual, as not all the items in the manual.
